Summary
Through this course I learned alot about the functionality that JavaScript can add to a 
web application. The combination of objects through JSON, styling through CSS, structure through
HTML, and functionality through JavaScript gives an app what it needs to function as if it
were a program directly installed on the user's computer.  I would like to get a better understanding
of some of the tools used like Vagrant, git.bash, Express and Mongo. These are good tools to test and run
an app before publishing, but my lack of knowledge of the commands, and how to handle error messages, made this
project difficult.
